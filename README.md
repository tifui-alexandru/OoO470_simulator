### OoO470_simulator

This project implements a cycle-accurate simulator for a out-of-order processor called OoO470. The processor runs a small subset of RISC-V instructions (namely add, addi, mulu, divu and remu).


The simulator reads an assembly program and dumps the state of the
microarchitectural data structures at each cycle.

This project is part of the [Advanced Computer Architecture](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/advanced-computer-architecture-CS-470) course that I took
in my MS'c in Cyber Security.
